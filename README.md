Cocktails - Android Mobile App with Modern Architecture
This is a mobile application built with modern Android development tools and libraries. It leverages Jetpack Compose for a declarative and efficient UI, Room for local data persistence, Dagger for dependency injection, Retrofit + OkHttp for network communication, Coil for image loading, Firebase for analytics, and adheres to the MVVM architecture pattern.

Key Features:

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose): Build a beautiful and responsive UI with a declarative and composable approach.
[Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room): Store data locally on the device for offline access and efficient retrieval.
[Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger): Simplify dependency injection and improve code maintainability.
[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) + [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/): Make efficient and reliable network requests with advanced features like caching and interceptors.
